          EVIS2023 Abu Dhabi Market Gateway is an opportunity for exhibitors to
          connect with potential buyers and create business opportunities
          throughout the three days of the event. By understanding your
          requirements we will help you connect with Investors, Potential
          Partners (including dealers, CPOs, fuel retailers, real estate
          developers) and Government Officials from across the Middle East
          region. The Middle East region is leading the EV transition and
          countries across the region are investing in enabling this transition
          to happen from building EV manufacturing faculties such as Lucid
          Motors and Ceer in Saudi Arabia, installing wide public charging
          infrastructure such as DEWAâ€™s public charging network in Dubai and
          more. All of these initiatives are resulting in a faster adoption rate
          of EVs by individuals and companies and are creating many business
          opportunities for companies and investors. EVIS2023 will have more
          than 200 companies exhibiting from over 50 countries from across the
          globe.
